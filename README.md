## Project History
**(2/27/2018)**  
What is the sound of two programmers with no time and a broken framework?

Short answer: trivia night at the Pub.

Tonight, in lieu of our testing framework causing us issues that it shouldn't have to the point that our project became unusable, we have made the decision to refresh and refactor our project. However unfortunate that it is that this is happening 24 hours before the project deadline, we believe to be the only way to at least produce something functioning.

The main issues that we solved during this time is routing issues in how Javascript source files where being loaded. Through this we much better acquainted with our refreshed and refactored framework, as it was a missing field in one of the import statements causing things to not load as they should.

We were unable to solve a particular error during this time (see Issues) as we did not exactly have a good access to power, and a single laptop that was well below 20%, but we were able to get almost back to where we were.
